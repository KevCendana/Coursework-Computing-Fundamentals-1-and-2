# Summary

My first assignment!

For this assignment, I had to:
- Calculate and display gas mileage based on user input
- Calculate and display a user's height in total inches and centimeter's based on user input
- Print a fast food receipt based on user input (name of food item and it's price)

# Instructions (Copy Pasted from Canvas and Formatted)

Complete all tasks listed below. All commands should go in one main.cpp file together, in order.

Important: Read through all tasks first. You need to decide what variables you need for the program and declare all of those variables before any other commands.

**Part A**

- Ask the user "How many miles did you drive last week?"

- Ask the user "How many gallons of gas did you use during that time?"

- Tell the user what their average gas mileage (MPG) was last week by dividing the number of miles by the number of gallons.

**Part B**

Ask the user to enter their height by prompting them for two inputs that look like this:

- feet:  (user types a number here)

- inches:  (user types another number here)

Report the user's height back to them in total inches. Repeat for centimeters. 

**Part C**

Ask the user for their name.

Ask the user to enter three items purchased at a restaurant along with their prices. The resulting behavior should look like this example below -- note that text in bold is SAMPLE input only, your program will not look exactly like this, it must respond to whatever your user actually enters.

- Enter 1st item: burger
- Enter price of the burger: 6.75
- Enter 2nd item: fries
- Enter price of the fries: 2.50
- Enter 3rd item: milkshake
- Enter price of the milkshake: 3

Determine the subtotal cost by summing the three item prices. This should be stored in its own variable.

Determine the amount of tax by multiplying the total times 0.0925
(This represents a sales tax of 9.25%, the current rate in Livermore.)

Print a report matching the following form. (Again, bold names and prices are sample data, your program should use whatever your user actually enters each time.)

**Receipt for Karen**
- burger    $  6.75
- fries     $  2.50
- milkshake $  3.00
- Subtotal  $ 12.25
- Tax       $  1.13
- TOTAL     $ 13.38
