# Summary

In this assignment, I had to create two classes to create a task list.
- Users could create a "Task" class with a title, location, and priority.
  - Users can change the priority of the Task as well as give a description.
- "Task" classes would be added to a "TaskList" class.
  - Users can add to the TaskList and complete any tasks.
  - Users can display tasks sorted by prioriy or location.
