# Summary

For this assignment, I created a class called PairValue, and redfined operators to work with the class.

A PairValue is a simple class with two numbers.

I changed some operator signs to do different things. Some examples include...

- I changed the + and - signs to add/subtract two PairValues together.
- I changed the * sign to multiply a PairValue's two numbers, repeat this with another PairValue, and add the results together
- I changed the ++ sign rotate PairValues. Ex) (7,3) turns into (-3, 7)
